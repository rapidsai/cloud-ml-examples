# RAPIDS on AWS 
This directory contains a few examples to get started on using RAPIDS on AWS. The sections in this README are the following:

1. Instructions for Running RAPIDS + SageMaker HPO
2. Instructions to run multi-node multi-GPU (MNMG) example on EC2
3. Instructions for Running RAPIDS + SageMaker Studio
4. RAPIDS MNMG with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) using Dask Kubernetes

## 1. Instructions for Running RAPIDS + SageMaker HPO 

0. Upload train/test data to S3 

   - We offer the dataset for this demo in a public bucket hosted in either the `us-east-1` or `us-west-2` regions:
   > https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/sagemaker-rapids-hpo-us-east-1/   
   > https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/sagemaker-rapids-hpo-us-west-2/
   
   
1. Create a SageMaker Notebook Instance

   - Sign in to the Amazon SageMaker console at 
   > https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/
   
   - Choose **Notebook Instances**, then choose 'Create notebook instance'.
   - Note that this notebook is for SageMaker notebook instances only, however instructions for running RAPIDS in SageMaker Studio can be found in the **sagemaker_studio** directory.

2. On the Create notebook instance page, provide the following information (if a field is not mentioned, leave the default values):
   - For **Notebook instance name**, type a name for your notebook instance.
   - For **Instance type**, we recommend you choose a lightweight instance (e.g., ml.t2.medium) since the notebook instance will only be used to build the container and launch work.
   - For **IAM role**, choose Create a new role, then choose Create role.
   - For **Git repositories**, choose 'Clone a public Git repository to this notebook instance only' and add the cloud-ml-examples repository to the URL
   > https://github.com/rapidsai/cloud-ml-examples 
   - Choose 'Create notebook instance'. 
   
   - In a few minutes, Amazon SageMaker launches an ML compute instance â€” when its ready you should see several links appear in the Actions tab of the **Notebook Instances** section, click on **Open JupyerLab** to launch into the notebook.   
   > Note: If you see Pending to the right of the notebook instance in the Status column, your notebook is still being created. The status will change to InService when the notebook is ready for use.

3. Run Notebook
   - Once inside JupyterLab you should be able to navigate to the notebook in the root directory named **rapids_sagemaker_hpo.ipynb**

## 2. Instructions to run MNMG example on EC2

We recommend using RAPIDS docker image on your local system and using the same image in the notebook so that the libraries can match accurately. You can achieve this using conda environments for RAPIDS too.

For example, in the `rapids_ec2_mnmg.ipynb` notebook, we are using `rapidsai/rapidsai:21.06-cuda11.0-runtime-ubuntu18.04-py3.8` docker image, to pull and run this use the following command. The `-v` flag sets the volume you'd like to mount on the docker container. This way, the changes you make within the docker container are present on your local system to. Make sure to change `local/path` to the path which contains this repository.

`docker run --runtime nvidia --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -p 8787:8787 -v /local/path:/docker/path rapidsai/rapidsai:21.06-cuda11.0-runtime-ubuntu18.04-py3.8`

## 3. Instructions for Running RAPIDS + SageMaker Studio

0. Upload train/test data to S3 

   - We offer a dataset for the HPO demo in a public bucket hosted in either the `us-east-1` or `us-west-2` regions:
   > https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/sagemaker-rapids-hpo-us-east-1/   
   > https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/sagemaker-rapids-hpo-us-west-2/
   
1. Create/open a SageMaker Studio session   

   - Choose **Amazon SageMaker Studio**, and set up a domain if one does not already exist in the region. See the Quick start procedure for details: 
   > https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/onboard-quick-start.html
   - Add a user to the SageMaker Studio Control Panel (if one does not already exist), and Open Studio to start a session.
   
2. Within the SageMaker Studio session, clone this repository

   - Click the Git icon on the far left of the screen (second button, below the folder icon), select Clone a Repository, and paste: 
   > https://github.com/rapidsai/cloud-ml-examples 
   
   - After cloning, you should see the directory **cloud-ml-examples** in your file browser. 

3. Run desired notebook

   - Within the root directory **cloud-ml-examples**, navigate to **aws**, and open and run the rapids_studio_hpo notebook. 

## 4. RAPIDS MNMG with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) using Dask Kubernetes

For detailed instructions of setup and example notebooks to run RAPIDS with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service using Dask Kubernetes, navigate to the `kubernetes` subdirectory.

- Detailed instructions to set up RAPIDS with EKS using Dask Kubernetes is in the markdown file [Detailed_setup_guide.md](./kubernetes/Detailed_setup_guide.md) . Go through this before you try to run any other notebooks.
- Shorter example notebook using Dask + RAPIDS + XGBoost in [Dask_cuML_Exploration_Intro.ipynb](./kubernetes/Dask_cuML_Exploration_Intro.ipynb)
- Full example with performance sweeps over multiple algorithms and larger dataset in [Dask_cuML_Exploration_Full.ipynb](./kubernetes/Dask_cuML_Exploration_Full.ipynb)

**NOTE:** At the time of writing this (July 2021), in EKS, there is a potential bug in the dataframe.compute call and other methods, which results in the movement of a large amount of data out of AWS to a local node, the local client on the user's notebook will restart and result in a `CommClosedError: in <closed TCP>: Stream is closed` error. From our experiments, this is an AWS-specific error. We didn't notice this on AKS or GKE with the same data and workflow. A potential solution would be to avoid moving too much data out from AWS to your local machine. For example, calling compute on a single column (e.g. a prediction column) would most likely be fine. But calling compute to bring an entire training dataset (which has been persisted on the workers) to the local machine with all rows and columns, then that operation may fail with high probability.
