# RAPIDS on AWS

There are a few example notebooks to help you get started with running RAPIDS on AWS. Here are the instructions to setup the environment locally to run the examples.

## 1. Instructions for Running RAPIDS + SageMaker HPO

0. Upload train/test data to S3 

   - We offer the dataset for this demo in a public bucket hosted in either the `us-east-1` or `us-west-2` regions:
   > https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/sagemaker-rapids-hpo-us-east-1/   
   > https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/sagemaker-rapids-hpo-us-west-2/
   
   
1. Create a SageMaker Notebook Instance

   - Sign in to the Amazon SageMaker console at 
   > https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/
   
   - Choose **Notebook Instances**, then choose 'Create notebook instance'.
   - Note that this notebook does not currently work in SageMaker Studio, due to lack of docker support. We plan to release a version with documentation on how to work around this limitation.

2. On the Create notebook instance page, provide the following information (if a field is not mentioned, leave the default values):
   - For **Notebook instance name**, type a name for your notebook instance.
   - For **Instance type**, we recommend you choose a lightweight instance (e.g., ml.t2.medium) since the notebook instance will only be used to build the container and launch work.
   - For **IAM role**, choose Create a new role, then choose Create role.
   - For **Git repositories**, choose 'Clone a public Git repository to this notebook instance only' and add the cloud-ml-examples repository to the URL
   > https://github.com/rapidsai/cloud-ml-examples 
   - Choose 'Create notebook instance'. 
   
   - In a few minutes, Amazon SageMaker launches an ML compute instance â€” when its ready you should see several links appear in the Actions tab of the **Notebook Instances** section, click on **Open JupyerLab** to launch into the notebook.   
   > Note: If you see Pending to the right of the notebook instance in the Status column, your notebook is still being created. The status will change to InService when the notebook is ready for use.

3. Run Notebook
   - Once inside JupyterLab you should be able to navigate to the notebook in the root directory named **rapids_sagemaker_hpo.ipynb**

## 2. Instructions to run MNMG example on EC2

We recommend using RAPIDS docker image on your local system and using the same image in the notebook so that the libraries can match accurately. You can achieve this using conda environments for RAPIDS too.

For example, in the `rapids_ec2_mnmg.ipynb` notebook, we are using `rapidsai/rapidsai:21.06-cuda11.0-runtime-ubuntu18.04-py3.8` docker image, to pull and run this use the following command. The `-v` flag sets the volume you'd like to mount on the docker container. This way, the changes you make within the docker container are present on your local system to. Make sure to change `local/path` to the path which contains this repository.

`docker run --runtime nvidia --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -p 8787:8787 -v /local/path:/docker/path rapidsai/rapidsai:21.06-cuda11.0-runtime-ubuntu18.04-py3.8`
